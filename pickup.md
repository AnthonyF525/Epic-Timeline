## Completed CRUD APIs

### 1. Sagas API (/api/sagas) ✅ COMPLETED
- Full CRUD operations
- Rich array validation for genres, themes, inspirations
- NO release status enum (musical is already complete)
- Statistics endpoints

### 2. Songs API (/api/songs) ✅ COMPLETED
- Full CRUD with array field handling
- Musical metadata: themes, characters, musicalMotifs
- Relationship management with characters
- Array validation for instruments, vocals, moods

### 3. Locations API (/api/locations) ✅ COMPLETED
- Coordinate validation (latitude: -90 to 90, longitude: -180 to 180)
- Boolean flags validation with business logic
- Real vs mythological location validation
- Geographic search capabilities
- Travel information and cultural significance

### 4. Characters API (/api/characters) ✅ COMPLETED
- CharacterType enum validation (MORTAL|GOD|MONSTER)
- Boolean flag logic (cannot be both protagonist/antagonist)
- Rich arrays: roles, traits, abilities, relationships
- Type-specific endpoints by character type
- Physical descriptions and voice actor info

### 5. Events API (/api/events) ✅ COMPLETED
- Relationship array handling (characters, locations, songs, sagas)
- Content arrays: witnesses, consequences, cultural impacts
- Weather and political context
- Timeline chronological ordering
- Boolean validation (historical vs mythological)

### 6. Comparisons API (/api/comparisons) ✅ COMPLETED
- ComparisonType enum validation
- Entity comparison framework with scoring
- Auto-generation capabilities
- Type-specific theme validation
- Advanced metrics and statistics

## Key Technical Features Implemented

### Array Field Validation Patterns
- Extensive validation for all list fields
- Duplicate prevention and cleaning
- Size constraints (min/max elements)
- Content validation against predefined lists
- Business logic validation

### Entity Relationship Management
- Cross-entity validation (IDs must exist)
- Bi-directional relationship handling
- Add/remove relationship endpoints
- Cascade validation for entity integrity

### Geographic Features
- Coordinate validation with proper ranges
- Proximity search within radius
- Region type validation
- Boolean flag business logic

### Comparison System
- Sophisticated scoring and criteria system
- Auto-generation of comparison criteria
- Type-specific validation rules
- Statistical analysis and breakdown

### Business Logic Validation
- Epic Timeline specific rules
- Character type transition logic
- Location real vs mythological validation
- Event historical vs mythological logic
- Cultural significance importance levels

## Current File Context
User was last viewing: `/Users/anthony/Project/Epic-Timeline/epic-timeline-backend/src/main/java/com/epicstuff/dto/AutoComparisonRequest.java`

This file contains validation for auto-generating comparisons with:
- ComparisonType enum field
- Entity ID validation
- Analysis type patterns
- Criteria count constraints
- Boolean flags for metrics/context inclusion

## Validation Patterns Used Throughout
- `@NotNull`, `@NotBlank`, `@NotEmpty` for required fields
- `@Size(min=X, max=Y)` for string and array constraints
- `@Pattern(regexp="...")` for enum-like string validation
- `@DecimalMin`/`@DecimalMax` for coordinate validation
- `@Valid` for nested object validation
- Custom business logic validation in service layers

## Epic Timeline Domain Specifics
- Characters: MORTAL, GOD, MONSTER types with mythological properties
- Locations: Real world places vs mythological realms
- Events: Historical vs mythological with cultural impact
- Songs: Musical analysis with narrative importance
- Comparisons: Academic analysis tool with scoring
- No release status tracking (musical is complete)

## Development Context
- Spring Boot backend with comprehensive validation
- Lombok for boilerplate reduction
- JPA/Hibernate for persistence
- RESTful API design with pagination and filtering
- Cross-origin support for frontend integration
- Professional-grade validation and error handling

## Architecture Quality
- Domain-driven design principles
- Enterprise-level validation patterns
- Proper service layer abstraction
- Consistent DTO patterns
- Comprehensive relationship management
- Academic research tool capabilities

The project represents a sophisticated backend for cultural heritage, mythology research, and educational platforms with extensive validation and relationship management capabilities.
