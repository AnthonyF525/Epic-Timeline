# Epic Journey Map - Fixes Completed •

## Issues Resolved

### 1. • → • White Screen on Dot Clicks
**Problem**: Clicking location dots led to white screens due to missing character data and modal crashes.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive character data to all 15 locations
- Each location now has detailed character information with names, titles, descriptions, powers, and roles
- Added safety checks in modal rendering to handle missing data gracefully
- Improved error boundaries with fallback content

**Characters Added**:
- Troy: Odysseus, Polites, Athena
- Cyclops Island: Polyphemus, Odysseus  
- Circe's Island: Circe, Hermes
- Underworld: Tiresias, Anticlea
- Thunder Saga: Scylla, Eurylochus, Zeus
- Wisdom Saga: Calypso, Telemachus, Athena
- Vengeance Saga: Calypso, Poseidon
- Ithaca Palace: Penelope, Odysseus

### 2. • → • Flashing Dots Issue
**Problem**: Three random dots were flashing continuously without purpose.

**Solution**:
- Controlled pulsing animation to only apply to significant locations
- Limited pulsing to Troy and Ithaca Palace (start and end of journey)
- Removed unnecessary divine realm pulsing
- Added conditional logic to prevent random locations from pulsing

### 3. • → • Song Auto-Play Feature
**Problem**: Songs weren't playing automatically when clicking location dots.

**Solution**:
- Implemented auto-play functionality in `handleLocationPress`
- When a location is clicked, the first song associated with that location automatically plays
- Integrated with existing audio player context
- Songs like "The Horse and The Infant" now play when clicking Troy
- "Polyphemus" plays when clicking Cyclops Island

### 4. • → • Click Detection Issues  
**Problem**: Clickable overlays were causing conflicts and positioning issues.

**Solution**:
- Removed separate TouchableOpacity overlay system
- Implemented direct SVG circle click detection
- Increased click area radius from 5 to 8 pixels for better mobile UX
- Added hit detection to both invisible and visible circles

### 5. • → • Release Status/Dates Removal
**Problem**: UI was showing release status and dates which user didn't want.

**Solution**:
- Confirmed release status/dates are not displayed in UI
- Data structure preserved in backend but hidden from users
- SagaInfoPanel doesn't render release information
- Focus on content and experience rather than release timeline

## Technical Improvements

### Code Quality
- Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for character data
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks

- Reduced unnecessary re-renders

### User Experience

## Files Modified

## Testing Results •
